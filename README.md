The rapid integration of technology into everyday accessories presents an innovative approach to enhancing personal safety while preserving the aesthetic appeal of traditional ornaments. This research project explores the design and implementation of a "Smart Anklet" tailored for women's safety and convenience. Leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the smart anklet serves dual purpose of both a fashionable accessory and an advanced safety device.
By embedding discreet sensors and communication modules within the anklet, the device can detect and respond in a situation where the woman is in danger. In the event of an emergency, such as a distress situation or a perceived threat, the smart anklet automatically triggers an alert mechanism. This mechanism promptly sends distress signals to pre-designated family members and nearby law enforcement agencies, facilitating swift assistance and intervention.
